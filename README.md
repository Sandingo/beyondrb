# Pokémon Beyond Red and Blue [![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]

A romhack of Pokémon Red and Blue that includes various features from each iteration of Kanto, along with unused beta content found in the Gigaleaks.
Features:
- Beta versions of the Steel/Dark/Fairy types!
- Unused Pokémon from beta builds and future generation evolutions, as well as the inclusion of Kanto-exclusive 'mons from GSC (Houndour/Murkrow/Slugma)
- Added NPCs and trades to help with version exclusive or once per save Pokémon.
- Tradeback NPC in Celadon.
- FRLG Oak's Aide rewards! (Everstone + Amulet Coin)
- Move Deleter + Relearner in Fuchsia and Indigo Plateau respectively.
- References to hoaxes like Bill's Garden and the Mew under the truck.
- Gym Leader post-game rematches and slightly tougher boss trainer learnsets from Yellow version.
- Modern Exp. All sharing formula (Still requires 50 Pokémon caught to get)
- QoL with BW's reusable Repel system and HMs usable in the overworld.
- Daycare now has a PC, and there's a chance your Pokémon will have an Egg! (Living Dex possible in one save file?) 
- Improved Vitamins and purchasable PP Ups!
- Hyper Training!

For the full list of changes, see [**FEATURES.md**](https://github.com/Sandingo/beyondrb/blob/master/FEATURES.md)

The goal is to include as many beta features as possible, and some new Kanto-related ones, without changing the feel of Generation 1.
Pokémon are only type changed to their modern vanilla counterparts, however regional variants/regional fakes/gimmick forms/paradox forms etc. are NOT included.

Moves from later generations are only included if they fill out a new type, or act as a signature move for a Pokémon. Otherwise, no major changes have been made to individual species.
